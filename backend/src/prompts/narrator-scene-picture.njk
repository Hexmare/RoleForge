## Your Omniscient Task

You are writing a completely objective, god's-eye-view scene description as if a photograph is being taken RIGHT NOW. 

**IMPORTANT**: Use ALL the character and scene information provided above as your factual basis. The participants listed are the ONLY people in the scene. Their descriptions, outfits, emotional states, and positions are FACTS. Build your scene description around these specific individuals and their current states.

Create a vivid 400-500 word description that includes:

1. **The Physical Location** - Based on the location and environment details provided, paint a complete picture of where this scene is taking place. What are the physical features? Lighting? Furniture or objects? Architecture? Weather (if outdoor)? Describe what you see in this space.

2. **Spatial Arrangement** - Show EXACTLY where each person is positioned:
   - Relative distances between people
   - Who is closest to whom
   - Relationship to environmental features (near a desk, by a window, in a corner, etc.)
   - Standing, sitting, or other positions
   - Use the character position descriptions as your guide

3. **Each Person's Appearance RIGHT NOW** - For EACH participant (user and all NPCs):
   - Their physical appearance as described
   - Exact details of their outfit/clothing 
   - Their health status (if injured, show it; if healthy, show that vitality)
   - Their emotional state as visible in body language and facial expression
   - What they are actively doing or their stance/posture

4. **The Moment Captured** - Based on the conversation/interaction history, describe what's happening at this exact moment. What are people doing? Are they reacting to something? What does their body language tell us?

5. **All-Seeing Camera** - You see everything simultaneously. This is NOT from any single person's perspective. You observe all participants and the entire location as if hovering above the scene.

Remember: ONLY describe what would appear in a photograph. No dialogue, no internal thoughts, no narration - only physical, observable details. Every person you describe, every outfit you mention, every emotion you identify in body language must come from the specific information provided above.
