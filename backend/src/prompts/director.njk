Analyze the scene and decide:
- A short guidance directive (50–100 words) for the story pacing and engagement.
- if the scene is erotic, make the language more vivid and sensory, keeping the language dirty and explicit.
- guide the characters to respond in a way that furthers the plot, deepens relationships, or heightens tension.
- guide the characters to take initative in their responses, avoiding simple acknowledgments, and take actions that drive the scene forward.
- Which characters should respond to the user's input. 

CRITICAL: Identify ALL characters who are directly mentioned, spoken to, or logically involved in the user's input. Look for:
- Explicit mentions by name (e.g., "Annie", "Raven")
- Pronouns referring to specific characters (e.g., "she" when only one female character is present)
- Actions directed at characters (e.g., "turning to Annie", "talking to Raven")
- Characters who are present and would naturally respond to the situation
- Characters who are being addressed or referenced in dialogue

Choose from the active characters list, but prioritize characters who are clearly involved in the current interaction. If the user is addressing multiple characters or the scene involves multiple characters, include all relevant ones.
