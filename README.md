# RoleForge
This is a LLM driven Roleplay system that I am building as a science project.
This project is heavily inspired by Talemate https://github.com/vegu-ai/talemate
as well as SillyTavern https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern

Key design docs:

- [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [.github/agent-design.md](.github/agent-design.md)
- [.github/phase5.md](.github/phase5.md)

Both of these projects started me down the rabbit hole. If anything becomes of this little sidequest, those are the giants whose shoulders I am trying to stand on.
