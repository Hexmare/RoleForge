## 🎓 Knowledge Transfer Ready

Anyone on your team can now:

✅ Understand what a "round" is (specification)  
✅ Understand why rounds are needed (VectorStorage foundation)  
✅ Know what to build (detailed requirements)  
✅ Know how to build it (37 detailed tasks)  
✅ Know how to test it (30+ test examples)  
✅ Know how to commit (git conventions)  
✅ Know how to manage phases (dependencies)  
✅ Know when they're done (acceptance criteria)

## 🔗 Integration with VectorStorage

**Before**: VectorStorage proposal had 9 clarification gaps
**Now**: All clarifications resolved via Rounds prerequisite  
**Result**: VectorStorage implementation will be ~50% faster

VectorStorage relies on Rounds for:
- Clear memory capture boundaries (1 round = 1 memory)
- Explicit character scoping (activeCharacters list)
- Clear trigger point (roundCompleted event)
- Deterministic query pattern (like lore system)
- No ambiguity about injection points
