Metadata canonical types: confirm canonical types for campaignId, arcId, sceneId, roundId (integers vs UUID/strings). Current guidance: integers OK but support UUIDs — should we store all metadata as strings in vectors for robustness? --> Yes
messageId inclusion: should messageId be included on every vector for precise edit/regenerate tracing? (speakerId was noted optional.) --> yes
Temporal decay semantics: halfLife is expressed as message count — confirm how to compute an item's "age" for decay (count of messages since the vector was created, or time-based using timestamp), and confirm default behavior. --> This will be difficult to do , off the top of my head , we will need to do a count of records in the messages table after the vector was created. This will need to be filtered by identifying records where the user is included. ( either their uuid is in the characterspresent, or their name in the sender field )
Delete behavior and safety: when deleteByMetadata runs across many scopes, confirm expected behavior (sync vs background job), and whether admin confirmation/flags are required to avoid accidental mass deletes. --> If we have an instance where we find that we are crossing worlds in a removal yes we should have an approval needed. 
Revectorize existing data: do you want an on-demand migration tool (one-off) to revectorize all existing legacy vectors under canonical scopes as part of Phase 1, or defer that to a later maintenance step? --> Already have a tool that will do a revectorize by scene that is manually triggered. This will suffice. 
personalizeMemory() hook signature: confirm preferred signature (e.g., (text: string, characterId: string, context?: any) => Promise<string>) or accept the default pass-through stub. --> That signature is good to start , and can be expanded later if needed.
conditionalRules matching details: confirm support for nested field matching (e.g., metadata.keywords) and exact vs substring matching semantics. --> Yes lets support all of these, ( Configurable )
Diagnostics endpoint exposure: confirm whether diagnostics endpoints should be admin-only (authenticated) or available to the dev/debug UI without auth. --> We don't have an auth system in place at the moment.
